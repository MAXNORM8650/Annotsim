Annotsim: Self-Supervised Anomaly Segmentation via Diffusion Models with Dynamic Transformer UNet (WACV 2024) ðŸ“ˆ

This repository presents Annotsim, a novel self-supervised anomaly detection method for image segmentation. It utilizes a diffusion model with the Tsimplex noise function, optimized for high-dimensional and colored images. At its core is a Dynamic Transformer UNet (DTUNet), a modified Vision Transformer capable of handling time and noise image patches as tokens. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical imaging datasets.

Key Features
	â€¢	Custom Diffusion Models: Incorporates selective denoising with extended UNet.
	â€¢	Dynamic Transformer Blocks: Enhances anomaly segmentation with dynamic adaptability.
	â€¢	Simplex Noise Integration: Supports advanced noise generation for improved diversity.
	â€¢	Visualization Tools: Outputs diffusion videos, detection results, and interpretability plots.
	â€¢	Metrics: Built-in tools for computing precision, recall, and Dice scores.
