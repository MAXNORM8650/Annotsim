# Annotsim: Self-Supervised Anomaly Segmentation via Diffusion Models with Dynamic Transformer UNet (WACV 2024) ðŸš€

This research paper introduces a novel self-supervised anomaly detection method for image segmentation. It employs a diffusion model utilizing a newly developed four-dimensional simplex noise function (**Tsimplex**) for improved efficiency and sample quality, especially in higher-dimensional and colored images. The core of the model is a **Dynamic Transformer UNet (DTUNet)**, a modified Vision Transformer architecture designed to handle time and noise image patches as tokens. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing generative-based anomaly detection methods, particularly in medical imaging. The source code is publicly available.

## Features

- **Custom Diffusion Models**: An extended UNet with selective denoising capabilities.
- **Dynamic Transformer Blocks**: Enhancements for dynamic anomaly segmentation.
- **Simplex Noise Integration**: Supports 3D/4D noise generation for improved feature diversity.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics**: Tools to calculate precision, recall, Dice score, and more.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generates diffusion videos and detection outputs for interpretability.
